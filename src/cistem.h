/*	CISTEM Stemmer for German

	This is the official Perl implementation of the CISTEM stemmer.
	It is based on the paper
	Leonie Wei√üweiler, Alexander Fraser (2017). Developing a Stemmer for German Based on a Comparative Analysis of Publicly Available Stemmers. In Proceedings of the German Society for Computational Linguistics and Language Technology (GSCL)
	which can be read here:
	http://www.cis.lmu.de/~weissweiler/cistem/
	
	In the paper, we conducted an analysis of publicly available stemmers, developed
	two gold standards for German stemming and evaluated the stemmers based on the
	two gold standards. We then proposed the stemmer implemented here and show
	that it achieves slightly better f-measure than the other stemmers and is
	thrice as fast as the Snowball stemmer for German while being about as fast as
	most other stemmers.
